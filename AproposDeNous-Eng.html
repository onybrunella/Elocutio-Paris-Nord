                        <p>
                            Hello, my name is Samuel Dorismond, I am 18 years old and I work for the company 
                            LOC-SOC IMAGINER as a Project Manager. I'm mainly in charge of 
                            the general organization of projects, both in the design of the project itself 
                            and in the coordination of the activities to be carried out.
                            This work is quite technical in the sense that as project manager, 
                            we need to have a knowledge pointed in several various fields and varied 
                            like as communication: which passes mainly by the analysis of the needs of our customers 
                            or in the IT field to master the techniques and the methods of programming methods.
                            <br><br>
                            What I like about LOC-SOC IMAGINER is that my position allows me to wear several hats: 
                            I can both manage my project team and participate in the production of a project. 
                            Recently, as part of a project to organize a day dedicated to eloquence, 
                            I have myself contributed to the design of the website.
                            <br><br>
                            In short, to do this kind of job, you have to be a good listener, have a spirit of negotiation 
                            and, above all, have good stress management skills in order to best lead your teams.

                            In this way, I am mainly in charge of developing all the pages within the company related to digital law. 
                            I must therefore put my legal knowledge to the benefit of the websites so that they respect all the rules 
                            and laws established by the government. In this sense, I realize the legal pages of websites, these pages 
                            contain mainly the legal mentions that the owners of the site make sure to respect , the responsibility,
                            the general conditions of sales if it is an e-commerce...
                            <br><br>
                            To exercise this profession, it would be necessary to have skills and knowledge in law 
                            and also in terms of web programming. It is necessary to be rigorous enough to bring 
                            a suitable solution for each different customer profile.

                        <p>
                            Hello, my name is Rayane Tigrini, I am 19 years old, I work as a translator
                            in the company LOC-SOC IMAGINER.
                            <br><br>
                            My job is mainly to translate the company's website. The role of the translator 
                            is to translate certain written documents from one language to another, 
                            to transmit the content, context and style of the original text as faithfully as possible.
                            But also I have to revise and correct the translated texts. Not to mention, 
                            I have to help my colleagues if they have difficulties with certain texts for example.
                            <br><br>
                            To do this job, you have to know how to write to translate well, be organized, 
                            be punctual because there are deadlines to meet. But you also need to be flexible 
                            and know how to adapt to to the different contents to be translated.
                        </p>
